abstract: 'Decision-making is a central yet under-defined goal in visualization research. While existing task models address decision processes, they often neglect the conditions framing a decision. To better support decision-making tasks, we propose a characterization scheme that describes decision problems through key properties of the data, users, and task context. This scheme helps visualization researchers specify decision-support claims more precisely and informs the design of appropriate visual encodings and interactions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to characterize decision tasks targeted by existing design studies, highlighting opportunities for future research in decision-centric visualization.'
