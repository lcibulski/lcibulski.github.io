abstract: Design studies create visualizations that provide lasting solutions to real-world problems. Yet, they rarely validate this goal. Validation of domain usefulness typically stops shortly after the end of a project. Following up on the long-term acceptance, however, can provide important indications of how well a tool addresses the true needs of target users. For an existing decision support tool, we close this gap by revisiting its adoption in the target domain after four years. Our survey reveals a small number of power-users and helps carve out factors that influence whether and how a tool is adopted in the intended work environment.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
