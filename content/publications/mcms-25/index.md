abstract: 'We present ViBBS, a card-game based learning framework for students
to explore the infovis design space on their own. At its
core are cards with building blocks that represent visualization design
concepts. Students are required to combine suitable building
blocks (visualization idioms, interactions, etc.) to tackle challenges
posed by visualization scenarios. This can be combined with different
mechanisms to create games that suit different learning goals,
skills, topics, and experience levels. Our research question is how
game mechanisms can be created for different learning situations
and challenges, and how these are adopted by our students.'
