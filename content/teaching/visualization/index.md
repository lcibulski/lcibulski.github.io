## Prerequisites

There are no enforced prerequisites for this course.
However, a general interest in data visualization and computational approaches is recommended.

## Course Mechanics

The course combines lectures with exercise sessions that revisit and augment the lecture contents on volume visualization, flow visualization, and information visualization.
The exercises make use of tools like ParaView and Observable notebooks to provide (programming) assignments that gradually build and extend an interactive visualization and thereby put the lecture contents into practice.
The assignments incrementally work through the stages of transforming volume data, vector data, and abstract data into an interactive visualization.
For each stage, we will provide an intermediate solution.
