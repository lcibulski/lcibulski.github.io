location: TU Wien, Austria

summary: 'TU Wien, Austria'
abstract: 'This talk provides different perspectives on using data visualization to assist and inform choices. We face many choices in our personal and professional lives. Computing has made it easy to compile large numbers of options to choose from. Identifying the best solution among such a set is called multi-attribute choice. With no objectively optimal solution present, our human judgment is needed to trade off conflicting goals.

Data visualization is a powerful tool to help us explore and make sense of available courses of action. While many interactive visualizations already live in the context of decision-making, how to design for humans who make decisions with visualized data continues to be a vibrant research area. In this talk, I will touch upon different properties of multi-attribute choices. I will also hint at the role of related disciplines like decision theory. Finally, I will lay out some open visualization challenges along with examples where our visualizations helped learn what level of performance is achievable under which conditions.'
